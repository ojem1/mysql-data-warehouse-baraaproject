What geographic markets offer the highest growth potential?

How can we increase customer retention and lifetime value?

What operational changes would optimize our product mix and inventory?

2. Methodology
Analytical Tools and Approach
This analysis was conducted using MySQL Workbench 8.0, selected for its robust capabilities in handling relational data and complex analytical queries.

Why MySQL was appropriate for this project:

✅ Relational Data Handling: Our dataset contains complex relationships between customers, products, and sales transactions

✅ Advanced SQL Features: MySQL's support for window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK()), CTEs, and complex joins enabled sophisticated analysis

✅ Performance Optimization: With nearly 100,000 records across multiple tables, MySQL's query optimization ensured efficient execution

✅ Data Standardization: MySQL's comprehensive functions for string manipulation, date calculations, and conditional logic facilitated data cleaning

Data Processing Workflow
Data Extraction Phase:

Collected 6 disjointed datasets from 2 primary sources:

CRM system (customer and sales data)

ERP system (product and inventory data)

Source tables included:

Raw customer information

Product catalog with hierarchies

Sales transaction records

Customer location data

ETL Process:

Extraction: Pulled raw data from source systems using targeted queries

Transformation:

Applied data cleaning with TRIM(), CASE, and COALESCE functions

Standardized categorical values (country names, product categories)

Created surrogate keys using ROW_NUMBER() OVER()

Handled NULL values with appropriate defaults

Deduplicated records while preserving most recent data

Loading: Consolidated into 3 refined tables:

dim_refined_cust_details (customer dimension)

dim_prefined_product_details (product dimension)

fact_refined_sales_details (sales fact table)

Analytical Techniques Applied:

Aggregation Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG() for measures

Grouping Operations: GROUP BY for dimensional analysis

Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK() for key generation

Date Functions: TIMESTAMPDIFF() for age calculations

Conditional Logic: CASE WHEN...THEN...END for data standardization

Join Operations: INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to connect dimensional data

Quality Assurance Process:

Verified data integrity with count comparisons

Validated join logic with sample record checks

Confirmed calculation accuracy with spot checks

Ensured referential integrity across tables

This methodology transformed raw operational data into a star schema optimized for analytical queries, enabling the business insights presented in this report.

Trimmed whitespace from text fields using TRIM()

Data Standardization:

Applied consistent naming conventions across all tables

Standardized date formats for analysis

Created surrogate keys for dimensional tables using ROW_NUMBER()

Harmonized values across different source systems

Data Consolidation:

Combined CRM and ERP customer data into a single dimension

Linked product information with category hierarchies
